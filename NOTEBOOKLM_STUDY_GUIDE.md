### Sample Generated Notes Structure

```markdown
# Chapter 2: Kinematics

## 1. Introduction to Motion
- Definition: Change in position with time
- Types: Linear, Circular, Projectile
- Key Terms: Displacement, Distance, Speed, Velocity

## 2. Speed vs Velocity
### Speed
- Scalar quantity
- Rate of change of distance
- Always positive
- Formula: s = d/t

### Velocity
- Vector quantity
- Rate of change of displacement
- Can be negative
- Formula: v = Œîx/Œît

## 3. Acceleration
- Rate of change of velocity
- Formula: a = Œîv/Œît
- Types: Uniform, Non-uniform
- Units: m/s¬≤

## 4. Equations of Motion
### For Uniform Acceleration:
1. v = u + at
   - Use when: time is known
   - Variables: velocity, acceleration, time

2. s = ut + ¬Ωat¬≤
   - Use when: displacement needed
   - Variables: displacement, initial velocity, time

3. v¬≤ = u¬≤ + 2as
   - Use when: time unknown
   - Variables: velocities, acceleration, displacement

## 5. Important JEE Concepts
- Relative motion
- Graphs of motion (s-t, v-t, a-t)
- Free fall problems
- Common trick questions

## 6. Common Mistakes
‚ùå Confusing speed with velocity
‚ùå Wrong sign conventions
‚ùå Ignoring vector directions
‚úÖ Always draw diagrams first!
```

## üé¥ Creating Flashcards for Active Recall

### Why Flashcards Work

Research shows **active recall** is the most effective study technique:
- Forces your brain to retrieve information
- Identifies weak areas immediately
- Uses spaced repetition for long-term retention
- Perfect for formulas, definitions, and concepts

### Method 1: AI-Generated Flashcards

**Prompt Template:**
```
Create 50 flashcards for JEE Main covering this chapter.

Format each flashcard as:
Q: [Question]
A: [Concise Answer]

Include:
- Definitions (20 cards)
- Formulas (15 cards)
- Conceptual questions (10 cards)
- Problem-solving strategies (5 cards)

Make questions challenging but clear.
```

**Example Flashcards Generated:**

```
Q: Define instantaneous velocity
A: Rate of change of displacement at a specific instant.
   Mathematically: v = lim(Œît‚Üí0) Œîx/Œît

Q: What is the SI unit of acceleration?
A: meter per second squared (m/s¬≤)

Q: State the first equation of motion
A: v = u + at
   Where v=final velocity, u=initial velocity, a=acceleration, t=time

Q: When do you use the equation v¬≤ = u¬≤ + 2as?
A: When time (t) is not given and you need to find velocity or displacement

Q: What is the difference between distance and displacement?
A: Distance: Total path length (scalar)
   Displacement: Shortest path from start to end (vector)
```

### Method 2: Topic-Specific Flashcards

```

**Mathematics Formulas**
```
Q: Quadratic formula
A: x = [-b ¬± ‚àö(b¬≤ - 4ac)] / 2a

Q: Chain rule
A: d/dx[f(g(x))] = f'(g(x)) √ó g'(x)

Q: Integration by parts
