### Coaching Tone Examples

**Encouraging (Default):**
> "üéâ Amazing progress! You've improved by 15% in Kinematics. Keep pushing forward!"

**Professional:**
> "Analysis complete. Kinematics accuracy improved by 15%. Continue current study plan."

**Strict:**
> "Progress noted: +15% in Kinematics. However, 3 weak areas remain unresolved. More effort required."

**Friendly:**
> "Hey! You're doing awesome! üåü That 15% jump in Kinematics is incredible. Let's keep this momentum going!"

## üìä Understanding Analytics

### Weak Area Severity Calculation

```typescript
const avgAccuracy = totalAccuracy / cardCount;

if (avgAccuracy < 50) severity = 'critical';      // Needs urgent attention
else if (avgAccuracy < 60) severity = 'high';     // Significant struggle
else if (avgAccuracy < 70) severity = 'medium';   // Some difficulty
else severity = 'low';                             // Minor issues
```

### Priority Assignment

Priority (1-5, where 1 = highest):
- **Critical severity**: Priority 1
- **High severity**: Priority 2
- **Needs tutor help**: Priority 1-2
- **Low success rate**: +1 priority
- **Multiple failures**: +1 priority

### Improvement Tracking

```typescript
improvement_percentage = ((current_accuracy - initial_accuracy) / initial_accuracy) * 100

// Status updates:
if (current_accuracy >= target_accuracy) ‚Üí 'resolved'
else if (improvement > 10%) ‚Üí 'improving'
else ‚Üí 'active'
```

### Study Consistency Score

```typescript
consistency_score = (days_studied_in_period / total_days_in_period) * 100

// Ranges:
90-100%: Excellent consistency
70-89%: Good consistency
50-69%: Fair consistency
<50%: Needs improvement
```

import { supabase } from './utils/supabase';

await supabase.from('student_weak_areas').insert({
  student_id: 'user-uuid',
  subject: 'mathematics',
  topic: 'Integration by Parts',
  subtopic: 'Complex functions',
  weakness_severity: 'high',
  priority: 2,
  identified_from: 'tutor_session',
  identification_reason: 'Student attempted 10 problems, solved only 2 correctly',
  current_accuracy_percentage: 20,
  initial_accuracy: 20,
  attempts_count: 10,
  failures_count: 8,
  target_accuracy_percentage: 85,
  ai_recommendations: [
    'Review the ILATE rule',
    'Practice 5 basic problems daily',
    'Watch video on technique',
    'Discuss complex cases with tutor'
  ]
});
```

### Milestone Celebrations

Automatically triggered when:
- **First Improvement**: Accuracy increases by 5%+
- **Consistency**: 3 consecutive successful repetitions
- **Target Reached**: Achieves target accuracy
- **Mastery**: Maintains 90%+ for 2 weeks
- **Streak**: Studies for 7 consecutive days

Points awarded:

### Custom Recommendation Types

```typescript
const recommendationTypes = {
  study_plan: 'Complete structured study plan',
  resource: 'Check out specific learning resource',
  tutor_session: 'Book tutor for this topic',
  practice: 'Solve practice problems',
  revision: 'Revise previously learned concepts',
  break: 'Take a break to avoid burnout',
  motivation: 'Motivational message'
};
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Weak Areas Not Being Identified

**Check:**
1. Student has sufficient activity (flashcards, chapters, sessions)
2. Run manual analysis: `performComprehensiveWeakAreaAnalysis(studentId)`
3. Verify data is being logged correctly
4. Check threshold settings in `ai_coaching_config`

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Force analysis
await identifyWeakAreasFromFlashcards(studentId);
await identifyWeakAreasFromChapters(studentId);
```

### Coaching Sessions Not Generating

**Check:**
1. `ai_coaching_config` exists for student
2. `coaching_enabled` is true
3. Sufficient data for analysis (min 1 week of activity)

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Manual generation
await generateDailyCoachingSession(studentId);
```

### Repetitions Not Scheduling

**Check:**
1. Weak area has `target_repetitions` set
2. `auto_schedule_repetitions` is enabled
3. No existing repetitions scheduled

**Solution:**
```typescript
// Force schedule
await scheduleRepetitions(weakAreaId, studentId);
```

### Performance Issues

**If analytics are slow:**
1. Ensure indexes are created (check schema file)
2. Limit date ranges for queries
3. Use pagination for large result sets

```typescript
// Optimize by limiting period
const analytics = await getLatestAnalytics(studentId, 'weekly');
// Instead of 'all_time'
```
