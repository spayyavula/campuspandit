67c4a670-9e66-41ff-9334-f6eef47cc4b2	Understanding Relative Velocity in Straight Line Motion	Two trains, Train A and Train B, are moving on parallel tracks in the same direction. Train A travels at a speed of 60 km/h, while Train B travels at a speed of 90 km/h. If Train B passes Train A, how long will it take for Train B to be 15 km ahead of Train A?	mcq	medium	physics	general	Class 11	{Motion in a Straight Line}	1	2	true	2025-07-14T02:23:04.271Z	2025-07-14T02:23:04.271Z	{}
